## Server vs. Client Component Boundaries in next.js
- Do all server-only logic (like database access) in server components or api routes.
- Fetch data on the server, then pass it as props to client components.
- Handle all client-side logic and UI in client components.
- Colocate client components in a _components folder for clarity.
- Keep server/client boundaries explicit to avoid context errors and improve maintainability.
