To manage worktrees, use the `wt` cli
If it fails to run, you may need to install `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@johnlindquist/worktree` globally

## Create a New Worktree

Assume the user wants to create a new worktree based on their input unless they specify otherwise.

## Stop and Wait for User Input

After you create the worktree, stop and wait for the user's next steps.

Usage: wt [options] [command]

Manage git worktrees and open them in the Cursor editor.

Options:
  -V, --version                       output the version number
  -h, --help                          display help for command

  new [options] [branchName]          Create a new worktree for the specified
                                      branch, install dependencies if
                                      specified, and open in editor.

                                      merge them into the current branch, then
                                      remove the branch/worktree
  purge                               Safely remove all worktrees except for
                                      the main branch, with confirmation.

Examples:

wt new feature/login
wt new feature/chat --checkout
wt new feature/auth -p ./auth-worktree

wt new feature/vscode -e code
