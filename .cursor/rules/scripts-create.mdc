# Creating Scripts

Create a `scripts` directory in the current project
Create TypeScript scripts that we'll run with the "bun" executable (but keep them fully compatible with node)
Use the `bun` shebang line to run the scripts with bun: #!/usr/bin/env bun
Make the script executable by running `chmod +x <script-name>`
