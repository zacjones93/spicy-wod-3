## Problem

Athletes and coaches need a fast, reliable way to create, view, and edit CrossFit-style workouts. Existing solutions are either too rigid, too slow, or too cluttered. We want spicy wod to make workout management as simple and explicit as possible, with a UI that's bold, readable, and never gets in the way.

## Solution

Build a brutalist, grid-based interface for creating, viewing, and editing workouts. The workflow should be obvious: create a new workout, see all its details, and edit anything as needed. All fields (name, description, scheme, movements, tags, etc.) are always visible and editable. The UI should be fast, minimal, and responsive.

## Rabbit Holes

- Complex validation for workout schemes (e.g., EMOM, AMRAP, etc.)
- Handling associations with movements and tags
- Ensuring edits don't break existing logged results
- Permission checks (only allow editing by workout creator or admin)
- Handling mobile layouts and touch interactions

## No-Gos

- No WYSIWYG or rich text editorsâ€”keep it plain and explicit
- No nested modals or popups
- No auto-saving drafts (explicit save only)
- No support for bulk editing or batch operations in this cycle

## Risks

- Schema complexity: Supporting all CrossFit workout types without making the UI confusing
- Data integrity: Editing a workout shouldn't break past results or associations
- Performance: Must remain fast even with many workouts and associations

## Scope

- **Create Workout**: Form with all required fields, validation, and association pickers for movements and tags.
- **View Workout**: Readable, grid-based display of all workout details, including associated movements, tags, and a log of past results.
- **Edit Workout**: Edit any field, update associations, and save changes.
- **Navigation**: Easy access from workout list to create/view/edit screens.
- **Permissions**: Only allow editing by the workout's creator or admin.
