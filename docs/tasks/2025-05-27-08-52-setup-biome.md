# Task: Set up and configure Biome for spicy-wod project

## Commit 1: chore: initialize Biome configuration ✅ bd967cd

**Description:**
Initialize Biome configuration for the spicy-wod project. This commit will create a `biome.json` configuration file using Biome's init command, ensuring consistency with the brutalist design philosophy and Next.js App Router patterns mentioned in the PRD. The configuration will enable linting, formatting, and import organization with recommended rules. This aligns with the project's tech stack (Next.js, pnpm, TypeScript) and brutalist UI approach requiring no rounded edges and clear, functional code style.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test:**
    - **Command:** `pnpm biome check --write app/ lib/ components/ --dry-run`
    - **Expected Outcome:** `Biome runs successfully without errors, showing configuration is properly initialized and validates TypeScript/React files in core directories`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `Run biome init command and verify biome.json file creation`
    - **Expected Log:** `biome.json file created with schema reference, linter enabled, formatter enabled with tab indentation, and recommended rules activated`
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** `Direct file verification via cat biome.json`

## Commit 2: feat: configure Biome rules for Next.js and project standards ✅ 7834afc

**Description:**
Configure Biome with project-specific rules that align with the spicy-wod codebase standards. This includes setting up rules for React/Next.js patterns, TypeScript best practices, and import organization. Update `biome.json` to include specific rules for the App Router structure (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/` directories), disable conflicting ESLint rules, and configure import sorting for the project's import patterns (React, Next.js, Drizzle ORM, Zod, utility imports). Set quote style to match existing codebase patterns and configure line width for brutalist code style consistency.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test:**
    - **Command:** `pnpm biome lint app/ components/ lib/ --reporter=json`
    - **Expected Outcome:** `JSON output shows no linting errors, proper import organization detected, and TypeScript/React rules properly applied to existing files`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `Run biome check on existing files to verify rule application`
    - **Expected Log:** `Biome processes files with configured rules, shows import organization changes, and formatting adjustments according to brutalist style guidelines`
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** `Use --verbose flag to see detailed rule application`

## Commit 3: chore: update package.json scripts and remove ESLint dependency ✅ e47bd1b

**Description:**
Update `package.json` to replace ESLint with Biome by modifying the existing `lint` script to use `biome check --write`, add new scripts for `lint:check` (dry-run), `format` (formatting only), and `check` (comprehensive check). Remove ESLint dependencies (`eslint`, `eslint-config-next`) from devDependencies since they conflict with Biome and are no longer needed. Update the existing `lint` script to `biome check --write .` to maintain compatibility with existing workflows while providing comprehensive linting, formatting, and import organization.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test:**
    - **Command:** `pnpm lint && pnpm format && pnpm lint:check`
    - **Expected Outcome:** `All new scripts execute successfully, no ESLint references remain, and Biome performs linting, formatting, and checking without conflicts`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `Execute each new script and verify no ESLint dependencies remain`
    - **Expected Log:** `package.json shows updated scripts, no eslint packages in devDependencies, and all Biome commands execute with proper output`
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** `Use pnpm list to verify ESLint removal and script execution logs`

## Commit 4: fix: apply Biome formatting and linting to entire codebase

**Description:**
Run Biome's check command with `--write` flag across the entire codebase to apply consistent formatting and fix any linting issues. This includes files in `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and configuration files like `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `drizzle.config.ts`. Apply import organization to ensure proper import ordering (React, Next.js, external packages, internal modules). Fix any formatting inconsistencies and ensure all TypeScript/React files follow the configured Biome rules while maintaining the project's brutalist design principles and functional clarity.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test:**
    - **Command:** `pnpm biome check . --dry-run`
    - **Expected Outcome:** `No formatting or linting issues detected, all files pass Biome checks, import organization is consistent across the codebase`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `Run git diff to verify formatting changes and biome check output`
    - **Expected Log:** `Git diff shows consistent formatting changes, proper import ordering, and biome check reports clean codebase with no violations`
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** `Use git status and git diff to track changes applied by Biome`

## Commit 5: docs: update README and add Biome usage guidelines

**Description:**
Update the project README.md to document the new Biome setup, including available scripts (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`, `pnpm check`), editor integration instructions for VS Code and other editors, and guidelines for maintaining code quality. Add a section explaining the transition from ESLint to Biome, the rationale for the choice (performance, unified tooling), and how it aligns with the project's brutalist design philosophy and development efficiency goals. Include pre-commit hook recommendations and CI integration notes for consistent code quality.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test:**
    - **Command:** `pnpm biome check README.md && grep -q "biome" README.md`
    - **Expected Outcome:** `README.md passes Biome checks and contains documentation about Biome setup and usage`
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `Verify README.md content includes Biome documentation and usage examples`
    - **Expected Log:** `README.md contains sections for Biome scripts, editor setup, and development guidelines with proper formatting`
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** `Direct file content verification and grep commands for key documentation elements`
